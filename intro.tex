\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
	The second exercise of the lecture Rechnersysteme II revolves around the implementation of a software solution for acquiring satellite signals in the Global Positioning System (GPS). Target hardware is the AMIDAR processor, with its dynamic hardware acceleration capabilities based on the CGRA concept. The later sections of this chapter provide a brief overview of both AMIDAR and the CGRA.

	The main assignment of the exercise is to implement a working GPS acquisition algorithm and then optimise it in two dimensions: performance and energy consumption. Detailed descriptions for both sub tasks can be found in the following chapter [\ref{cha:task}], while the implementation details are deferred to chapter [\ref{impl}].
